- **Register**: Users sign up with full name, email, and password, user details are being stored in a JSON file as a mock DB.
- **Login**: Users log in with email and password which must have been stored in the json file, and an HTTP only cookie is being set for session management.
- **"Keep Me Logged In"**:
  - ✅ Checked: Session persists until manually logged out.
  - ❌ Unchecked: User is automatically logged out after 1 minute of inactivity.
